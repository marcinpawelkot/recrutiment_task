## Setting up python environment

Assuming you have set up docker environment, you can run application with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will create two containers: one with a database and second with the app, which will seed database and provide basic statistics about the data.

In my project I used code from articles:
1) https://hakibenita.com/fast-load-data-python-postgresql
2) https://towardsdatascience.com/flattening-json-objects-in-python-f5343c794b10
